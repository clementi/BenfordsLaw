# BenfordsLaw

This is a project I've created to investigate [Benford's Law][benford], which states that, in many real-life sources of data, the distribution of the first digit of the elements of these data sources is distributed according to `log10(1 + 1/d)`, where `d` is the first digit.

This project was created also to help me learn the [R programming language][r].
