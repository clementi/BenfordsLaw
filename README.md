# BenfordsLaw

This is a project I've created to:

* Learn the [R programming language][r] and
* investigate [Benford's Law][benford],

which states that, in many real-life sources of data, the distribution of the first digit of the elements of these data sources is distributed according to `log10(1 + 1/d)`, where `d` is the first digit.
